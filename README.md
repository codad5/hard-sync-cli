# Hard-Sync-CLI 

**Hard-Sync-CLI** is a simple and efficient command-line tool to sync files between two directories. It is written in **Rust** for speed and reliability. 

---

## üöÄ **Why Hard-Sync-CLI?**

I built this project for two main reasons:

1. **Learning Rust**: This project helped me learn Rust through hands-on experience.
2. **Practical Use**: I needed an easier way to sync files between my laptop and external hard drive (e.g., my movie collection) without the headache of dealing with duplicate file dialogs or manual comparisons.

## üì• **Installation**

### Install From Source
#### Prerequisites
- **Rust** (including `cargo`) installed on your system. [Get Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

#### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hard-sync-cli.git
   cd hard-sync-cli
   ```

2. Install the CLI tool globally using `cargo`:
   ```bash
   cargo install --path .
   ```

3. Run the tool to confirm installation:
   ```bash
   hsync --help
   ```

### Install From Binary
1. Download the prebuilt binary from the [Releases Page](#) (coming soon).
2. Add the binary to your system PATH (if needed).
3. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   hsync --help
   ```

## üíª **Usage**

### General Help
To see the help message, run:
```bash
hsync --help
```

### Syncing Directories
To sync files between two directories, use the following command:
```bash
hsync sync --src <source_directory> --dest <destination_directory>
```

#### **How It Works**
- **Files in Source Not in Destination**: Copied to the destination directory.
- **Files in Destination Not in Source**: *Ignored* (not deleted).
- **Modified Files**: If the source version is newer, it replaces the destination version. Otherwise, no changes occur.

#### **Options for `sync`**
| **Flag**          | **Short-Hand** | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--init`          | `-i`           | Initializes Hard-Sync metadata in the destination folder. Required for first-time syncing. |
| `--reverse`       | `-r`           | Reverses the source and destination directories (syncs in the opposite direction). |
| `--both`          | `-b`           | Synchronizes both directions (source to destination and destination to source). |
| `--src <path>`    | `-s <path>`    | Specifies the source directory to sync from.                                    |
| `--dest <path>`   | `-d <path>`    | Specifies the destination directory to sync to.                                |

#### **Examples**
- First-time sync:
  ```bash
  hsync sync -s /path/to/source -d /path/to/destination -i
  ```
- Reverse sync:
  ```bash
  hsync sync -s /path/to/source -d /path/to/destination -r
  ```
- Bidirectional sync:
  ```bash
  hsync sync -s /path/to/source -d /path/to/destination -b
  ```

### Ignoring Files and Directories

To ignore files or directories from being synced:
1. Create a file named **`hard_sync.ignore`** in the destination directory.
2. Add the files or directories to be ignored using the same syntax as a `.gitignore` file.

#### Example of `hard_sync.ignore`:
```plaintext
# Ignore all `.tmp` files
*.tmp

# Ignore a specific folder
ignore-this-folder/

# Ignore a specific file
do-not-copy.txt
```
